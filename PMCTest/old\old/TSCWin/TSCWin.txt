© 2005 GNU General Public License www.gnu.org/licenses

This program is intended for optimizing a little piece of code written in 
assembly. The code to test is inserted at the indicated place in
TSCTestB32.asm or TSCTestB64.asm.

The code to test will be executed REPETITIONS times and the test results
will be output for each repetition. This program measures how many clock
cycles the code to test takes in each repetition.

Compile and link TSCTestA.cpp and TSCTestB32.asm or TSCTestB64.asm for 
console mode Windows, 32 or 64 bits.

File list:
----------
TSCTestA.cpp:      C++ Source code for 32 and 64 bit mode.
TSCTestB32.asm:    Assembly source code for 32 bit mode.
TSCTestB64.asm:    Assembly source code for 64 bit mode.
